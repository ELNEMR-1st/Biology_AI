# üß¨ BiologyGPT - Intelligent Biology Assistant

## üìñ IDEA
A simple AI chat that can generate answers to questions related to biology in a structured format of:
- **MAIN ANSWER** 
- **KEY POINTS**
- **SOURCE CONTEXT**

With memory of five previous questions and their answers, including a delete button (X) to clear history.

## üöÄ HOW IT WORKS
1. You type a biology question in the web interface
2. The system searches through a database of 40,000+ biology passages
3. It finds the most relevant information for your question
4. The AI generates a clean, structured answer with main points and context
5. It remembers your last 5 questions and answers for follow-up questions
6. You can clear the conversation history anytime with the delete button
